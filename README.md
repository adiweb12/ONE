# Geekhoot (Flutter)

This is a minimal Flutter project bundle prepared for you. It includes:
- pubspec.yaml
- lib/main.dart (minimal launcher)
- lib/ONE.dart (your original app code kept separate)
- codemagic.yaml configured to build Android APK only
- test/widget_test.dart (dummy test to satisfy CI)

IMPORTANT:
- Because you are on mobile and cannot run `flutter create .`, this zip contains basic platform scaffolding but may NOT include the full Gradle wrappers that `flutter create` generates locally.
- If Codemagic still fails during Android build due to missing Gradle wrapper files, the recommended fix is to run `flutter create .` locally on a desktop and replace the lib/ and pubspec.yaml, or ask me to generate a more complete project (larger).
